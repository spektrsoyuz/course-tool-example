In the second part, topics in heat transfer are used uch as conduction in solids, fin design, convection, heat exchangers, and radiation. In a third part, selected topics in electrical conductive media and reaction engineering are also covered. This course compliments MECH-322 and MECH-420 and could be considered an extension of the two courses where problems are solved in 2D and 3D using computational software. Different types of meshes will be discussed, post-processing of data will be analyzed through graphical techniques, and graphical results will be compared to well-known analytical solutions. Students will also complete a final project where both fluid mechanics and heat transfer physics will be used to solve practical engineering problems.",

How does the justice system deal with issues of race, class, gender, and ethnicity? Why is the justice system inaccessible to the poor? These are some of the questions that will be explored in this course.
